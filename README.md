Here I outline the post-install configuration of the open-source help desk ticketing system osTicket.<br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Microsoft Remote Desktop
- Internet Information Services (IIS)

<h2>Operating Systems</h2>

- Windows 10</b> (22H2)

<h2>Post-Installation Objectives</h2>

- Configure Roles and Departments
- Configure Teams and allow anyone to create tickets
- Now we will configure agents/workers and user/customers
- Configure SLA
- Configure Help Topics

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

- _This walkthrough assumes that you went through the <a href="https://github.com/Emq17/osTicket-Prerequisites-and-Installation/tree/main">"Prerequisites and Installation"</a> demonstration to successfully install osTicket_

<h1>Configuration Steps</h1>

# Admin Panel

> **Note***
>**Admin vs Agent:** *The Admin panel is used by the Administrator of the osTicketing System carrying out tasks like setting up the tickets, defining roles & SLA's, and general administrative duties (ex. Sys Admins) whereas Agent is used by the Workers (Helpdesk Professionals) who actually uses the platform instead of setting things up and solving user problems.*

<h3>Creating Roles</h3>

>**Note***
>**Roles represent the permissions given to Agents based on their access to specific Departments. Each Role comes with a customizable set of permissions that can be enabled or disabled. You can create an unlimited number of roles and assign them to Agents with access to different departments.*

- Right now we are on the `Agent` panel because we can see it give us the option to switch to `Admin` on the top right of your screen
